- Write a program that asks the user to enter today’s sales rounded to the nearest $100 for each of three stores. The program should then display a bar graph comparing each store’s sales. Create each bar in the graph by displaying a row of asterisks. Each asterisk should represent $100 of sales.

- Here is an example of the program’s output. User input is shown in bold.

- Enter today’s sales for store 1: 1000[Enter]
- Enter today’s sales for store 2: 1200[Enter]
- Enter today’s sales for store 3: 900[Enter]

-  DAILY SALES 
- (each * = $100)
- Store 1: **********
- Store 2: ************
- Store 3: *********
