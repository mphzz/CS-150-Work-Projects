Modify the MovieData program completed above, to include two more
members that hold the movie’s production costs and first-year revenues. 

The constructor should be modified so that all six member values can be specified when a MovieData variable is created. 

Modify the function that displays the movie data to display the title, director, release year, running time, and first year’s profit or loss. 

Also, improve the program by having the MovieData variables passed to the display function as constant references.
