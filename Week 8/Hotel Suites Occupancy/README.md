# HotelSuiteOccupancy
- Write a program that calculates the occupancy rate of the 120 suites (20 per floor) located on the top 6 floors of a 15-story luxury hotel.
- These are floors 10–12 and 14–16 because, like many hotels, there is no 13th floor.
- Solve the problem by using a single loop that loops once for each floor between 10 and 16 and, on each iteration, asks the user to input the number of suites occupied on that floor.
- Use a nested loop, loop to validate that the value entered is between 0 and 20.
- After all the iterations, the program should display how many suites the hotel has, how many of them are occupied, and what percentage of them are occupied.
