# Movie Data
Write a program that uses a Class named MovieData to store the following information about a movie:

- Title
- Director
- Year Released
- Running time (in minutes)
 
Include a constructor that allows all four of these member data values to be specified at the time a MovieData variable is created. The program should create two MovieData variables and pass each one in turn to a function that displays the information about the movie in a clearly formatted manner. Pass the MovieData variables to the display function by value.
